I am a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Michigan (Michigan Institute for Data Science) under the guidance of <a href="https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/">Dr. David Jurgens</a> and <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/index.html">Dr. Lu Wang</a>. I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Iowa State University under my advisor <a href="https://sites.google.com/iastate.edu/qili/">Dr. Qi Li</a>. I have also worked as a Data Science intern at The Home Depot, Epsilon, and as a Data Analytics intern at Delaware North. My research interests are in the domain of data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. Through my research, I have contributed several key methods in top conferences like ACL, UAI, SIGKDD, PAKDD, SIAM, ESEC/FSE, journal like TKDD and workshops like ICLR, ICML, WWW, PAKDD, RANLP.</span>
